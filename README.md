# About Me and A Quanta of Philosophy

#### Physicist, pianist, artist, and also aspiring to become a philosopher and a mathematician.

### About Me

Theoretical physicist undergrad at the University of São Paulo, I currently carry out research on topics related to black holes, dark energy/matter and physical cosmology. In my spare time I feel like reading, drawing/painting, playing the piano or even attending to the gym. Time and time again I also dedicate much of that time – already scarce – to some nerdy stuff, whether it's reading a manga or playing some videogames. I also have great interest in philosophy, particularly in epistemology, ontology and philosophy of science, in the problem of demarcation and in the realism/antirealism debate.

### About A Quanta of Philosophy

A Quanta of Philosophy comes with the main purpose of become my personal archive of the subjects that I enjoy to study. The subjetics that are most likely to appear here are things related to Physics, Mathematics and Philosophy, but occasionaly I may post something related to drawings/paintings, music or even videogames, if it's something I find interesting enough to make a post about.&#x20;
